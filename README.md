# Simply Jekyll - A simple jekyll theme

Simply Jekyll is a simple yet highly functional jekyll-based theme that combines the best of different worlds (atleast tries to ðŸ˜…). It is a minimal and distraction free theme that strives to provide maximum value all without holding back on any essential features that a user would benefit from or would desire for. This is an evolving project and is garanteed to be maintained at least for quite some time as I myself am a beneficiary of this theme and the project.
